## Geeting Started

To use the Rashwanth Drag & Drop web page, follow these steps:

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.

2. You will see two boxes, one on the left and one on the right.

3. The left box contains a list of items that can be dragged and dropped to the right box.

4. To drag an item, simply click and hold on it, and then move the mouse to the right box.

5. When the item is over the right box, release the mouse button to drop it.

6. You can drag and drop any of the items in the left box to the right box.

7. To remove an item from the right box, simply drag it back to the left box.

8. You can also add your own items to the left box by creating new HTML elements with the `draggable="true"` attribute.

9. The `draggable="true"` attribute tells the browser that the element can be dragged and dropped.

10. Once you have added your own items to the left box, you can drag and drop them to the right box just like the other items.


**Here are some additional tips for using the Rashwanth Drag & Drop web page:**

* You can use the `dragover` and `drop` events to customize the behavior of the drag and drop functionality.

* You can also use the `draggable` attribute to specify which elements can be dragged and dropped.

* The `draggable` attribute can accept a boolean value, or a list of elements that can be dragged and dropped.

* For more information on the drag and drop API, please see the MDN documentation:
